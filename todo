from MoralIntentions email:
- The possibility to use a practice board to play against yourself or to demonstrate something when you're giving chess lessons with your laptop or an interactive whiteboard (with the same features as and with a button beneath "Play with the machine" in Play). 
- The possibility to give other players a "thumbs up" or a "thumbs down" on their profile (which is only visible to the player who has given the thumbs up or thumbs down) so you can filter games (in Play) based on thumbs up (some players lack sportsmanship, this is a way to avoid them). It would be great if we could also filter "Who is online" (in People) that way, so we can see if it's likely that we'll find a fun opponent to play against. 
- More tie-breaking options and stats (in Tournament): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-breaking_in_Swiss_system_tournaments, especially Sonneborn-Berger and Tournament Performance Rating. 
- Several options of how points should be given to players (for example: Score * Sonneborn-Berger * Tournament Performance Rating * Percentage Score [for example: 0.64] / 1000) and therefore also several Leaderboards. 
- The possibility of team matches (with solutions for players who are in several teams), where the team leader has to choose the board order, where the team results are shown and where the team player (who has played all of the games of the match) with the highest Percentage Score gets crowned Player of the Match of team "A".
