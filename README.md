---------------------------------

It's a free online chess game focused on [realtime](http://lichess.org/games) and simplicity.

It haz a [search engine](http://lichess.org/games/search),
[computer analysis](http://lichess.org/analyse/ief49lif),
[tournaments](http://lichess.org/tournament),
[forums](http://lichess.org/forum),
[teams](http://lichess.org/team),
[puzzles](http://lichess.org/training),
and a weird [monitoring console](http://lichess.org/monitor).
The UI is available in [72 languages](http://lichess.org/translation/contribute) thanks to the community.

Lichess is written in [Scala 2.10](http://www.scala-lang.org/),
and relies on [Play 2.2](http://www.playframework.com/) for the routing, templating, and JSON.
Pure chess logic is contained in [scalachess](http://github.com/ornicar/scalachess) submodule.
The codebase is fully asynchronous, making heavy use of Scala Futures and [Akka 2 actors](http://akka.io).
Lichess talks to [Stockfish 4](http://stockfishchess.org/) using a [FSM Actor](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/blob/master/modules/ai/src/main/stockfish/ActorFSM.scala) to handle AI moves and analysis.
It uses [MongoDB 2.4](http://mongodb.org) to store about 20 million games, which are indexed by [elasticsearch 0.90](http://elasticsearch.org).
HTTP requests and websocket connections are proxied by [nginx 1.4](http://nginx.org).
New client-side features are written in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/tree/master/cljs/puzzle/src).

Installation
------------

> If you want to add a live chess section to your website, you are welcome to [embed lichess](http://lichess.org/developers). It's very easy.

> This project source code is open for other developers to have an example of non-trivial scala/play2/mongodb application. You're welcome to reuse as much code as you want for your projects, and to get inspired by the solutions I propose to many common web development problems. But please don't just create a public lichess clone. Instead, just [embed lichess using an &lt;iframe&gt;](http://lichess.org/developers).

> Also note that if I provide the source code, I do **not** offer support for your lichess instance. I will probably ignore any question about lichess installation and runtime issues.

### Read the move stream

Lichess streams all played moves on http://en.lichess.org/stream using chunked HTTP response and the following format:

```sh
ChunkSize        # size of the next chunk, in hexadecimal
GameId IpAddress # actual chunk of data
```

#### Try it with netcat

```sh
> echo "GET /stream HTTP/1.1\nHost: en.lichess.org\n" | netcat en.lichess.org 80

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Wed, 16 Oct 2013 20:01:11 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive

By comparing game IDs, you can guess who plays against who.
