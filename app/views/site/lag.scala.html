  <div class="answer long">
    And now, the longer answer! Game lag is composed of two unrelated values:
  </div>
  <div class="sections">
    <section class="server">
      <h2>Lichess server latency</h2>
      <div class="meter"></div>
      <p>
        The time it takes to process a move on the server.
        It's the <strong>same for everybody</strong>, and only depends on the server load.
        The more players and the higher it can get, but lichess developers
        do their best to keep it very low. It rarely exceeds 10ms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="network">
      <h2>Network between lichess and you</h2>
      <div class="meter"></div>
      <p>
        The time it takes to send a move from your computer to lichess server,
        and get the response back.
        It's specific to your <strong>distance from lichess (France)</strong> and
        to the <strong>quality of your Internet connection</strong>.
        Lichess developers can not fix your wifi or make light go faster.
      </p>
    </section>
  </div>
  <div class="last-word">
    <p>You can find both these values at any time, by clicking your username in the top bar.</p>
    <h2>Lag compensation</h2>
    <p>Lichess compensates for network lag, up to one second per move.
      After your move, <strong>your average network lag is added to your clock</strong>.
      As a result, having a higher network lag than your opponent is <strong>not a handicap</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now when you see someone complain about lag, you can send them to this
      page, so they can learn a thing or two :)</p>
