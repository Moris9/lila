## When will the tournament start?
As soon as @players players join it.
}
You will be notified when the tournament starts, so it is safe to
<a target="_blank" href="@routes.Lobby.home()">play in another tab</a> while waiting.

## Is it rated?
@rated.map { r =>
@if(r) {
This tournaments is rated and will affect your Rating.
} else {
This tournaments is *not* rated and will *not* affect your Rating.
}
}.getOrElse {
Some tournaments are rated and will affect your Rating.
}

## How to win?
The player/s with the most points at the conclusion of the tournament is/are victorious.
Winning a game is worth 2 points, a draw: 1 point, and a defeat is worth no points.

## What is the win streak?
It represents the number of games won consecutively.
As long as you don't break the win streak, you earn one more point per victory.
For instance, if you win 3 games in a row, you get 2 + 3 + 3 points.

## How does the pairing work?
At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired randomly.
As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby:
you will then be paired with the first available player. This ensures minimum wait time,
however you may not verse all other players in the tournament.
Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.

## How does it end?
The tournament has a countdown clock. When it reaches zero all current tournament games
are aborted; the tournament rankings are frozen, and the winner is announced.
