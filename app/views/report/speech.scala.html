@(link: Boolean)

When you see someone cheating or behaving wrongly,<br /><br />
<strong>DO NOT WRITE IT IN THE FORUM</strong><br /><br />
But @if(link) {
<a href="@routes.Report.form">fill this form</a>
} else {
fill this form
} to inform the moderators.<br />
Your report will be processed faster this way.
