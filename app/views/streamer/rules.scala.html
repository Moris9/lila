  <li>You will be listed on <a href="@routes.Streamer.index()">the lichess streamer directory</a>.</li>
  <li>When you stream with the keyword "lichess.org" in the stream title, you will be bumped up the top of the list!</li>
  <li>You are free to stream on other chess servers, or to stream non-chess things; just don't include "lichess.org" in the stream title then.</li>
