      This is a different rating category and way to find an opponent.
      You just enter the pool and the system will automatically pair you with an opponent,
      usually someone near your rating and someone you haven't played in the last few games.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have to wait a bit before it makes the pairing and starts the game,
      depending on how many other appropriate opponents are joining the playing pool.

      The games are @setup.clock.show, and are always rated in the @setup.name category.
      This is the only way to start a game in the 5-minute rating category.
      The hope is that by not allowing people to hand-pick their opponents,
      not only will the ratings be more accurate, but also there won't be nonsense
      like having people avoid playing you when you're underrated.

      Once the game starts, you should finish it. Disconnections are treated as losses.
      Of course, we realize that this means that players with unreliable network connections
      will tend to have lower ratings.
      But this rule eliminates a whole set of possible abuses and disputes.

      Computers and computer-assisted players are not allowed to play.
      Please do not get assistance from chess engines, databases, or from other players while playing.
