Usage examples:

  bleep                     # builds all client assets in dev mode (inline sources)
  bleep -w                  # builds all client assets and watches for changes
  bleep -p                  # builds minified client assets (prod builds)
  bleep analyse site msg    # specify isolated modules (don't build everything)
