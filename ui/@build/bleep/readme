Bleep is a script that builds and watches all ui source code and linked modules.  It is for
dev builds only.

Rename 'bleep.config.json.default' to 'bleep.config.json' and modify to tweak log format,
turn off/change colors, or exclude modules (and anything that depends on them).

Specifying one or more modules to watch as arguments will include all of their dependencies.
Passing a module as argument that depends on one excluded by bleep.config.json is an error.
Pass no arguments to build & watch everything.

So hit ui/bleep and begin coding.
