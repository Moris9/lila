Usage examples:

  build                     # builds all client assets in dev mode (inline sources)
  build -w                  # builds all client assets and watches for changes
  build -p                  # builds minified client assets (prod builds)
  build analyse site msg    # specify isolated modules (don't build everything)
  build -w dasher chart     # watch mode works for isolated modules as well
