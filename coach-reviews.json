Con respecto al tema de antes/despues de ICL, les comento que juego desde hace muchismos a√±os, desde torneos de club, intercolegiales, interuniversitarios , he llegado hasta jugar en primera en Rosario. Tambien he jugado torneos latinoamericanos y torneos abiertos, como el de La Bandera, en Rosario, o el de Mar del Plata, donde he enfrentado a grandisimos jugadores, y hasta obtuve ELO internacional, al ganar o empatar con varios de ellos en 2 a√±os consecutivos. Tambien he tenido la suerte de jugar contra grandes maestros (en simultaneas), por ejemplo, GM Nigel Short, GM Vladimir Kramnick y GM Bent Larsen a quien tuve la fortuna de ganarle. Y la preparacion nunca fue mi fuerte. Como ejemplo, les comento que era conocido por salir con aperturas \"raras\" y por jugar \"sin enroque\". Me alcanzo con esto para conseguir mis objetivos???. creo que si. Pero todo lo que jugaba era por lo que me salia en el tablero, mas alla de repasar en su momento, partidas de grandes maestros. Y mis aperturas o defensas eran muy limitadas, y no conocia nada de estructuras de peones. Desde que me invitaron a unirme a ICL, es como que estoy aprendiendo \"de nuevo\" a jugar ajedrez. Con conceptos, con planes, etc. Y mi ELO en liches varia entre 2000 y 2180 aprox, y no me preocupa perder o ganar ese ELO. Pero lo bueno es que estoy aprendiendo muchas cosas. Y me pregunto: \"a donde hubiera podido llegar si hubiera tenido una ICL cuando era joven???\". Bueno, los chicos que estan aca, aprovechen esta escuela para formarse como ajedrecistas y como personas, estudien y van a poder llegar muy lejos. Soy un \"simple jugador de club\", y estoy aprendiendo mucho con ICL, con Cristian a la cabeza. Estos tematicos han hecho que amplie mi repertorio. Por ejemplo, nunca estudie la defensa francesa. Ahora la uso muchisimo y con buenos resultados. La dragon, nunca la tuve en en cuenta, y ahora la estoy aprendiendo. Mi consejo es que aprovechen las clases y sigan los consejos de Cristian. ",

He helps you understand and learn from your mistakes, and he always celebrates your successes. He structures his lessons based on what you tell him you need help with, and if you aren't sure exactly, he'll go over your games to FIND what you need help with. He'll also answer any questions you have outside of your lessons and send you puzzles for homework with themes that he thinks will help you best, all without any extra cost to you.

He was able to pinpoint most of my weaknesses within a span on 15 minutes, and created a structured plan on how he's gonna fix them. The material each lesson and homework he provides is very instructive, and it challenges me each time in ways my previous coaches couldn't replicate.

It has been an invaluable resource for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their game. Thanks to Elshan's coaching, I was able to achieve one of my greatest accomplishments - winning the World School Chess Championship u15 in Panama with a score of 8.5/9.

For over 10 years of hovering in the expert level I had dabbled off and on with trying to make progress on my own and crack the master title with little success.  I'd met Elshan briefly a number of years ago at a tournament and remembered him being a very pleasant and genuine person, and knew of his reputation as a coach - so when I finally decided to look for a coach he was a natural fit.  \r\n\r\nEarly in our work Elshan was able to identify a few major areas needing improvement and to help tailor our lessons accordingly. Through an ongoing process of game review, opening preparation, and covering a variety of middle and endgame positions we have been able to make significant progress in these areas.  Elshan has helped encourage me to play new opening systems and become comfortable handling a much wider range of positions.  He also did a fantastic job of connecting opening work with typical middle game ideas to help develop a better feel for these systems.  He also provided helpful homework positions or recommended games/reading to supplement our work.  Elshan brings a high level of professionalism and knowledge to his lectures, and is also very grounded and personable in his interactions.  Overall really a pleasure to work with him.  \r\n\r\nAfter a long time stuck in the expert range I credit working with Elshan as a major part of breaking through to the NM title at age 35.  His guidance in focusing on areas for improvement was a key part of this, and something I had not been able to achieve by dabbling with a range of chess books on my own.  Progress does not come on a silver platter, but if you are willing to put in the work I highly recommend Elshan as a coach.  ",

During our lessons, she has divided the time between reviewing homework answers, the day's lesson content, and homework assignment.  \r\n\r\nI have found the homework to be challenging and the amount just right for weekly lessons.  This is my opinion being one who works a full-time job, married, and a 2-year-old in the house.  When I reached out I provided the context to her for my goals with chess, availability, etc. and feel she has tailored the workload to challenge me, yet not overwhelm me which is appreciated.  \r\n\r\nLesson content I expect will vary for everyone who chooses a coach due to skill level and goals.  I can say that as a relative beginner level player she is providing instruction on the fundamentals of playing the game in the opening, middle, and end game.  The homework allows one to apply the fundamentals learned during the lesson.  The review of the homework at the start of each provides a feedback loop to ensure what's being learned in the lesson is making its way onto the board.\r\n\r\nLike many of you, I have looked at pages of many different coaches, not knowing who or what I should do to take my game to the next level.  After my weeks of searching across sites, I am glad I sent a note to Cherry asking for a lesson.  Her lessons are a great value and therefore I recommend reaching out to her to schedule one if you're looking to begin working with a coach online.",

Looking for a coach, I selected Alejandro, not because he was one of the lowest priced coaches, more because I didn‚Äôt feel that with my considerable chess inexperience, I was worth an expensive coach. \r\nAlejandro is worth his weight in gold, and I‚Äôm lucky he is my coach. He‚Äôs a FIDE Master chess player, speaks excellent English, and is a great communicator. Alejandro is humble, not at all invasive, and very easy to get on with. Alejandro has patience and clearly has a love of chess, and also for sharing his great love of the game to others.\r\nMy greatest satisfaction with my chess coach, apart from now, regularly beating my older brother who never lost to me when I was a kid, is that he has taught me understanding of the many varied aspects and dimensions of the game in a very enjoyable way. \r\nYes, my ratings improved by hundreds since I started receiving coaching, but more importantly, Alejandro taught me the value of understanding coordination of the pieces, how to have good timing and also momentum. Movement and development are far more important to understand than just trying to increase ratings. Listening to Alejandro, and studying his lessons naturally improved my ratings.\r\nAlejandro explained the concept of the family of 16 pieces, and how they all need to be used when establishing your positions on the board. At each jump in my progress, Alejandro has shown me something new to enable me to reach for the next level of understanding. After six months of lessons, I remain keen. \r\n My greatest fear when choosing a chess coach, was that we wouldn‚Äôt get on. I‚Äôm 20+ years older than Alejandro, but his modest and patient approach would work well with players of all ages. \r\nI hope you choose Alejandro Gonz√°lez Vega, FIDE chess Master, a really talented chess player, and coach, and now, also my friend. Good luck.\r\n",

Studying classic games, analysing my games as well as targeting new puzzles goals have been at the core of my training until now. And that helped a lot! I've only played chess a few months in high school and have never played again for 18 years. I'm now not so far from achieving 2,000+ in correspondence games!

Right from the start, she has been truly engaged & focused her energy on helping me improve. She gauged my level of understanding very quickly and tailored her coaching plan to suit my needs. She knows exactly how to introduce new concepts gradually & structure the training.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things I would like to point out:\r\n- Her unhurried style really helps me learn new concepts & understand the theory without being intimidated by it. \r\n- She consciously deploys the socratic method by asking pertinent questions that challenge me to think of the best tactics / strategy instead of just 'teaching' me the moves / theory. She often observes me make the mistakes and then shows me a better way. That's what a coach is supposed to do!\r\n- She is fastidious in her approach and is a great lateral thinker; both these qualities make her a great Chess player and she challenges my mental faculties.\r\n- She is really approachable & builds an environment that makes it easy for me to ask any question, no matter how basic / silly it is. \r\n- She genuinely cares about my progress as a student & invests her time to gauge it. She takes the time to review my games and gives me feedback not just on the overall game, but on specific moves. \r\n- Most importantly, you can feel her passion for Chess in her voice & thought process. Another word that gets thrown around a lot is 'inspiring'. I don't take that word lightly either. I can genuinely say that Rucha's passion for Chess is infectious and inspiring!\r\n\r\nHand-on-heart, Rucha is an excellent coach & I would always recommend her for anyone who wants to improve their game.

Was I ever going to find such a teacher? Well, having experienced it firsthand, let me honestly opine something - Rucha is above and beyond what I was looking for! You ought to read about her achievements and her chess journey since her childhood. Yet, when she teaches, she keeps everything aside and her focus is on her student's improvement. She comes prepared, has a plan for every lesson, makes them fun, presentable, gives homework, expects it to be completed, and is sharp enough to reel your attention back should you deviate off-topic. The calmness, motivation, and care she shows rub off positively, and because of this, my kid wants to show his improvement in return. We are in this long term and I can certainly vouch that if you're looking to improve your game, whatever level you're at currently, Rucha is the one to mentor you, and take you leaps and bound. ",

Nello spiegare temi , aperture, finali accompagna sempre la teoria ad esempi o esercizi tratti spesso da posizioni giocate in passato a volte da lui stesso.\r\nInoltre cerca , quando possibile e/o utile, di collegare gli argomenti teorici al repertorio di apertura in modo da aiutare la memorizzazione.\r\nRitengo Andrea un maestro veramente valido ed in grado di migliorare uno scacchista in tutti gli argomenti.",

The material is in depth and  completely related to what Andrea has taught in the lesson. Andrea gives regular homework and recommendations for books to further understanding. Andrea covers very complex information at a speed slow enough for my nine year old child to learn and nothing is too much trouble for him! Andrea is inspirational and inspiring and a fantastic role model for son! My son works hard and loves learning from a grandmaster and following his games. My son looks forward to learning from Andrea for a very long time. My son is from England and understands Andrea perfectly!

Originalmente me iba a basar la elecci√≥n solo en la reputaci√≥n y rese√±as que ten√≠an en lichess pero vi que hab√≠a varios entrenadores con rese√±as excelentes pero que ven√≠an de perfiles falsos (cuentas que no ten√≠an ni 2 horas jugando en la plataforma). Por esta raz√≥n decid√≠ que lo mejor era entrevistar a los entrenadores y tomar una clase con cada uno de ellos para ver su metodolog√≠a, pedagog√≠a, habilidades de comunicaci√≥n y preparaci√≥n de clase. \r\n\r\nEste ejercicio fue algo que aconsejo deben hacer las personas que buscan un entrenador ya que les ayuda a saber que est√°n tomando la decisi√≥n correcta y que su dinero va a estar bien invertido. Ah√≠ pude ver entrenadores que llegan a improvisar la clase y pierden tiempo en cosas irrelevantes para el estudio, entrenadores informales que llegan tarde y entrenadores que preparan muy bien sus clases y que tienen su metodolog√≠a bien establecida. \r\n\r\nHumberto entra en la categor√≠a de los terceros, es alguien que sabe transmitir el conocimiento de una manera sencilla, que tiene una preparaci√≥n ajedrec√≠stica y pedag√≥gica muy s√≥lida y que es muy profesional y responsable en su papel de entrenador. Opt√© por elegirlo porque se adapta perfectamente a lo que estaba buscando y en las m√°s de 20 horas de clase que tengo al escribir esta rese√±a he notado como mi ajedrez ha crecido bastante.\r\n\r\nSi eres de los que lee las rese√±as para elegir a tu entrenador Humberto es alguien responsable, serio, profesional y que va a buscar la manera de que cumplas tus objetivos  (El m√≠o es pasar de 1700 a 2200 en un plazo de 12 meses, al d√≠a de hoy ya voy en 1900). A√∫n as√≠ te invito a que hagas el ejercicio de entrevistar a varios y si puedes toma una clase con los que consideres son los mejores candidatos para que est√©s seguro de tu decisi√≥n. ",

He's got a very deep and stable knowledge in chess. He's literally always up-to-date with all the opening nuances. Give him any position, and he'll know (or at least has a pretty good feeling about) the correct middlegame strategy, and what your opponent might try against your plan. When it comes to the endgame he's more like a machine than just a simple mortal man, because he can and will grind every bit out of the endgames. Also, if you think you can outcalculate him in a tactical battle, think again. :)\r\n2. His character. He's always a lot of fun, time just flies by during training sessions, I guarantee that you'll never be bored or feel bad after spending an hour of chess with him. His positive and objective attitude is truly contagious.\r\n3. His teaching style. He can explain even the most complex positions so easily that even a 9-year-old could catch the position's sense. He'll find the best opening that suits you, and will give you super broad and deep analysis about that. After this, it's really a matter of practicing and remembering. You'll simply adapt his approach to middlegames and endgames. This is the main reason why I keep being better.\r\nIn 2 years, I have gained 200 ELO points in OTB chess with his help, in spite that I barely play 20 rated games per year. I managed to surpass the dreaded 2000 ELO barrier, and I'm on my way to the FM title and beyond. :) Preparing for important matches feels like a ride in a theme park with Bal√°zs's teaching method. He was fully committed from the start, and this hasn't changed over the years.\r\nAll in all, if you want to have a visible progress, you must contact him. In my opinion, his hourly rate is a huge bargain compared to what you receive during the lectures.",

Despite not having met yet, he closely followed all my games and promptly answered any questions I had during the tournament breaks. This level of attentiveness was unprecedented in my previous experiences with other coaches.\r\n\r\n- During all our lessons, Bal√°zs demonstrated a deep understanding of chess and conveyed his insights in an easily comprehensible manner. I could freely ask him any questions without feeling judged, and he was quick to point out any mistakes in my game. His unique approach made me feel like he was always on my side and working with me to improve my game.\r\n\r\n- I had the pleasure of meeting him in person while playing in a league together. Before each round, he always wished me good luck and was happy to chat about how the game went if he finished his game before mine.\r\n\r\nMy results so far after working with Bal√°zs (for about two months and counting) are nothing short of impressive:\r\n\r\n-Within a month of working together, my rating increased by over 50 ELO points, and it appears there is more improvement to come.\r\n-I have beaten IMs and FMs, which I had always considered impossible before Bal√°zs's help.\r\n-I feel a lot more confident in my skills, and chess has become more enjoyable overall.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you are looking for a knowledgeable, supportive, and effective chess coach, I highly recommend Bal√°zs.",

He is also super-well prepared in the openings. He knows lines, theory, and master games in all of the lines I play. I was simply amazed by all the knowledge he had. In the middlegame, he always finds strong plans, ideas, and tactics that help me in my games. Before I started working with him, my rating fluctuated around 1850-1900. Instantly after I started working with him, My rating shot above 2000 USCF and I finally reached my goal of becoming an expert. Another huge advantage is he is an active player who currently competes around Europe. He keeps up with all the new opening novelties and surprises that help me in my games. Also, he gives me videos of grandmasters playing my opening that are super helpful. All in all, he is a wonderful and dedicated coach who helps players of all ratings take their game to the next level. ",

I'm absolutely amazed by his skill and love for the game aswell as his incredible professionalism and dedication when it comes to teaching. Wojciech really cares for my chess and my progress, he suggested a detailed training plan and training routine for me in the beginning including books on topics where I need to improve the most, on a level that i understand well and that are exciting and fun to work through. Wojciech is able to tell me exactly where my bad habits are and how i can get rid of them, this is extremly inspiring and motivating to work on my chess. I can always send him my tournament games and get a detailed Grandmaster Analysis of it in no time. The lessons are a really fun and challanging too, lately i was supposed to say everything i think out loud, from the first moment i saw the position until the moment i decided for a move. After I did that, he showed me what I missed, what principles and ideas I could follow and how he approaches the position himself.  Honestly, I've never expected such a level of support by a chess teacher. Wojciech is also an active chess player and it's great fun to follow his games against top Grandmasters, i also get cool insider information and stories of the world of elite chess :). I know that I have the best possible support with him as a teacher on my chess journey and i'm very greatful and honored to be his student. ",

Mental Models to use in most situations\r\n\r\nArtai has been a great coach and teacher. He's great at explaining complicated concepts in simple ways. Typically he will explain a more advance theory, then I'll ask him clarifying questions, and he'll be able to calibrate to my level of underestanding.\r\n\r\nI think being good at chess is \"easy\". You put in the work, you study, and you practice. But being a good Chess coach is very had as it requires a different skillset all together.\r\n\r\nArtai poses both of these skills which makes him a great coaching or sparring partner. \r\n\r\nBonus: He's really flexible and has always adapted to my schedule.

He is always willing to answer my questions, provide feedback on my games, and offer valuable insights and strategies to help me become a better player.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I appreciate most about CM Artai is his passion for chess.

Prior to my time with Coach K, I had regarded endgames with much uneasiness but he helped me surmount that fear by breaking down endgame positions into understandable parts. Now I head into the endgame with confidence in my playing ability. At the start of each lesson he analyzes one of your past games, and what I really enjoyed is that he genuinely wanted you to learn something from your games instead of criticizing your mistakes. Furthermore, he pointed out my errors in the middlegame and I improved in that area as well. He has increased my rating, helped me in my chess understanding, and boosted my confidence in weak areas.

Like just last year during April I was rated 1200 here on lichess, I played poorly and because I wasn‚Äôt that good I didn‚Äôt take chess that seriously. But then somewhere around May or June I joined a Summer Chess Camp by King‚Äôs Chess Academy and Srinath Sir was the coach, in just a month of his coaching I went up to 1600, I slowly improved and soon I started taking personal classes from him and my performance went up quickly. I started playing many tournaments and started winning more and more. Now I‚Äôm 2100+ on lichess and although I am unrated because I got serious into chess just last year and the pandemic prevented me from playing FIDE tournaments, I still beat a fair share of 1500+ FIDE and I give all credit to Srinath sir. He has a great opening knowledge and you can just ask and he will teach the opening thoroughly, he also analyzes your games and points out the mistakes and what you should do instead so you don‚Äôt repeat it. During each lesson, he gives small tips and teaches how to think while playing. And finally he has a great personality and is very fun to learn with. ",

One of the things I appreciate the most is his attitude - you can feel free to ask questions, he won't criticise you for your mistakes/lack of knowledge but will explain how do impove your weaknesses and avoid the mistakes in the future. He has a great feeling of sharp, dynamic positions and taught me how to carry out a position's evaluation what helped me pretty much to find the right game plan. I like the way he teaches - all excercises' solutions seem at once to be so obvious. He's really flexible when it comes to the time so if you have to shift the training for some reason, there is no problem with it. After every single lesson you get all the stuff you have just worked out and of course a homework(if the excercises are too easy for you, he will immediately notice it and adjust them to your level) - he's really conscientious about it! M√°t√©  responds quickly for any questions, also beyond the training, so you can easily get in touch with him. He also gives you some hints how to develop your skills(recommends books, openings, tournaments etc.). Last but not the least: When we discuss a topic/an issue, I adore the examples he gives because they show how beautiful chess is and how much fun you can experience plaing it! ",

FM Smith has been by far the best coach I have worked with so far. He has a deep, strategic understanding of the game and is able to work with his students and immediately identify their weaknesses. It took us just 2 lessons for him to spot all of my major weaknesses and he has been working with me diligently to help me overcome these weaknesses. At 1900, I thought I already knew some of the basic concepts in chess, but after working with FM Smith, I realized I had major misconceptions about chess principles. He has helped me to come up with an easy and digestible way of evaluating any chess position. As a result, when I play a game today, I have more clarity over the board and fewer candidate moves to consider (saving me countless hours on the clock!).

They have become a highlight of my week.  \r\n\r\nAs other reviewers have said, Dejan uses a 5-minute rule, where he instructs students to determine the best plan or move in a critical position in a master level game.  I‚Äôve found this to be extremely helpful in developing my thought process and positional understanding in chess.  The last 15 minutes of the lesson are a practice game in rapid format.  Dejan has students review this game themselves (no computer), send the annotations back to him, and then reviews them together every 3-4 lessons.  I can point to multiple OTB games where I‚Äôve directly used the concepts and motifs learned from the lessons and practice games.  As an example, I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm much more effective at taking advantage of my opponents‚Äô slow/inaccurate play in the opening/early middle game, simply because I‚Äôve seen how Dejan does it so effectively to me in practice games üòä.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of results, I‚Äôve gone from just under 1800 to 2100 on lichess rapid.

This has helped me understand not just my openings, but also tons of middlegames and plans that top grandmasters employ. \r\n\r\nHe's been extremely helpful in explaining what goes into making good moves and how to think like a grandmaster.  He has a clear and organized method of teaching that's easy to follow and will quickly help you find better moves on the chess board. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the excellent content, he's hilarious and fun to work with.  He's an incredibly strong player - ~2400 (Could probably be a GM given how young he is still), but he's never condescending or rude.

Most teachers I've used have given stock lessons from books on endgames, tactics or openings, but have never looked at a single game I've played or given any constructive criticism on my weaknesses beyond \"improve your tactical play\" or \"study this opening more\". Vladan's lessons cover not only the usual chess theory that you'd expect, but he also asks you to send him examples of longer time control (15 0+) games you've played each week, and then spends considerable time reviewing them with you. It can be a bit painful having someone else focus in so clearly on mistakes you've made, but if you genuinely want to improve then it's something you're probably going to have to do. Further to this, Vladan's English is very good, he's patient and a good communicator, explaining very clearly why moves were poor or what you should be looking at in any given position.

Yes..For those who want to achieve these things Grand Master Debashish will guide along the path..\r\nHere are the important features of his teaching style..\r\n1) What you can expect from a regular player? Insights about tournaments? About how to prepare? How to calculate? How to play in winning situation? How to play in a losing situation? This is what he regularly does in class.. Emphasis is greatly on practical chess\r\n2) Who isn't exited to play against a GM? I think everybody does..

He mentioned that he will be covering not only calculation, but also positional topics like- prophylaxis, space advantage, different types of weaknesses, etc. He also shares psychological experiences to learn from. He shows his own games once a week. Every Friday is a playing day where he creates a tournament and gives prizes. The best part of the tournament is that he himself also participates. The advantage of it is that the club level players like me get an opportunity to play against a Grandmaster. Recently he decided to keep position playing day, where he gives a certain position to play which I feel is quite interesting and useful at the same time. He is not only hardworking, sincere and passionate about chess, but is also very patient while addressing student‚Äôs doubts. \r\n   When I joined his group class in the first week of February, the Tata steel tournament had just got over. The biggest news for us Indians was Arjun Erigaisi finishing at dominating 1st place in the challengers section and qualifying for the next year‚Äôs masters category. Every Indian chess lover was sharing this news on different social platforms (I was one of them), but how many of us bothered to go through Arjun‚Äôs Tata steel tournament games? Very few, I guess. Debashis sir made sure that he analyzed Arjun‚Äôs each and every game deeply and break it down, so that players like us understood the behind-the-scenes action. I was amazed to see that there was so much to learn from those games. \r\n   I feel very fortunate to be a part of his group class and would highly recommend to all those who are serious about chess.

Additionally, many examples are from very common positions and I've found them very helpful in learning how to apply the ideas in my own games. The lessons have a good balance of lecturing and student interaction to make sure key ideas are understood. I also feel like Bojan does a good job of covering sub-optimal moves opponents could make and how to exploit them, I find myself almost never needing to ask \"what if opponent played x\" style of questions.\r\n\r\nSelf Study:\r\n  I am never finding myself in a position where I want to practice/improve at chess on my own time and do not have anything useful to do. Bojan provides a weekly exercise set based on the main idea of the lesson which is very useful for exploring and reinforcing the ideas learned. Additionally, he provides excellent daily tactical training (similar to lichess puzzles but hand-picked to explore a topic in depth, such as pins, double attacks, removing the defender, etc. ) and to your difficulty level.\r\n\r\nPersonalization:\r\n  The biggest improvement of learning chess with a coach rather than indepedently is having lessons, exercises, and a longer term plan/curriculum tailored to you personally, which Bojan excels in. He's flexible on scheduling, goes at your pace: matches your quantity and difficulty of daily exercises to how you want to study and play the game, and takes into account topics you want to learn about for planning future lessons.",

After working on chess on my own for a while (mostly on Chessable) I found myself stagnating and in need of different impulses. That‚Äôs when I reached out to Vjeko for coaching. I have been enjoying the coaching of Vjeko for about 2 months now and have not regretted starting it for a second. Vjeko is a very engaged person who visibly works very hard on being a great coach. Besides that he‚Äôs also a very pleasant person with a big passion for the game. He has written me a training plan based on my time available. He comes very prepared to our lessons and gives me daily exercises and homework for in the weekends. I love the structure it has given me in my chess practice building my chess on a solid foundation and understanding. My enjoyment and engagement with the game of chess has increased massively since I have started working with Vjeko and I would recommend everyone to contact him if you‚Äôre looking for a great coach.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me should you want some more student-insights of Vjeko‚Äôs coaching.

He will talk about your most recent games and will go through anything that he thinks needs improvement. He will then ask if you have any questions about any of your games or something else. After that he will have a specific topic he talks about and will have things prepared for you to work on and talk about with him. He waits patiently while you solve those things and then goes through them with you. Then when the lesson is almost done, he will ask you if you have any questions about what you learnt today. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if you want a coach who pays attention to each student, is organised, will give you great results (I myself have improved by 300 points and I have only had 5 lessons with him), is a very smart person, tells you things you wouldn‚Äôt have even thought of and is just a friendly guy, pick Dmitry Gordievsky. You will not regret it",

He also suggested openings based on MY style, rather than forcing his own repertoire on me, which I have seen many coaches do. \r\n\r\nHe is very professional as a coach and is always prepared for our lesson. He has given me professionally prepared PGN files for my opening repertoire that have been very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe lessons are very well structured where we begin by him answering any specific questions I may have related to any games I played that week. Then we get into discussion around a topic that we focus on for the remainder of the lesson. He has instructive examples for different topics that he uses to explain various aspects of the subject at hand. And he is very friendly and respectful towards a non-titled player - he gives ample time to think about a position and also discusses practical aspects such as time management, psychology etc.\r\n\r\nI have been working with Dmitry for around 3 months now and we have covered a variety of important topics so far such as calculation, evaluation, theoretical and practical endgames along with openings.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering working with a coach, I would highly recommend GM Dmitry who has a rare combination of being a great teacher along with being a strong grandmaster.\r\n\r\n",

				"text" : "Rail is a really good coach. I am sure of that for many reasons.  Since he started to teach my son, my son has added over 150  points of national rating and fulfilled the NCM. So he has got a big progress. He also became a winner of several international championships. During the tournaments the coach helped my son also psychologically how to play against lower and higher rating opponents.  And he always supported  when my son lost or won, the couch always found the right words. After they analysed the games, pointed out the mistakes. He helps to understand better every part of the game. He helps to find the openings according to the personal style. He helps to understand combinational and positional play as well. Every lesson Rail teaches my son a concrete topic. They view a theoretical point first, then they  find the examples from real games. Every time my son gets some homework to understand the topic better. Besides Rail is a nice person, he is reliable and intelligent. My point is that this coach really helps to become a better chess player from day to day and he helps to achieve new goals, I can see it on the progress of my son.",

She is funny and every coaching session is a joy I look forward to attending! \r\n\r\nFlavia‚Äôs homework is thoughtful and relevant. She works behind the scenes of our coaching sessions to create mission appropriate studies. She is accommodating to my upcoming on-line chess game and (on-line) tournament schedules . She makes time helping me prepare for them. Flavia and I then reviews the games after the event to help me learn from my mistakes. She has harnessed and transformed my ‚ÄúRambo-esque style‚Äù of playing to something that is more methodical and thoughtful but not dampening my creativity. I have become a more efficient and effective player for that. \r\n\r\nMy goal is to be an all-around solid player within a certain time and I am looking forward to successfully do that.

I knew little more than basic tactics and I connected with Alex about four months ago; his experience as a coach is evident as he's methodical, patient and above-all he makes you think. I haven't been able to put more than a couple hours practice between weekly lessons but I entered my first tourney a month ago as an unrated player. I took 4 wins/2 losses in the U1200 category, good enough to tie for 6th among 31 players plus bag the trophy for highest scoring unrated player (among six) and $50 in prize money. Highlight was a queen sac mating attack on the kingside just like the many practice exercises Alex gave me for homework. With chess what you put in is what you get out but it helps to make the greatest improvement for the effort put in and Alex will guide you down that path for sure.",

He keeps you grounded on the fundamental ideas, while building every week on something slightly new to expand it. He is cognizant that learning isn't an overnight milestone, and perhaps gives me leeway to learn/apply the ideas at my own pace. In addition to all of that, he isn't selfish with his time or knowledge. He regularly goes beyond what I would expect from a coach, and provides support/insights/homework/games even when Im interacting with him outside of official lessons. I've really enjoyed learning from him, and expect to continue doing so !",

But on the days I prefer to focus on something else during the session, such as analyzing a specific game I played, or discussing an issue I am having in the middle game, he is happy to dedicate the lesson to focus on this. \r\nThis makes learning more fun and efficient. \r\nAlso, I like the fact that our lessons are over lichess board and saved and annotated by him, for my future reference.  \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend him for anyone who is trying to improve their game.

Mauricio is affordable, easy to work with, has a love for teaching, and is simply an experienced and professional coach. \r\n\r\nNow, you may be thinking that for 20 dollars, you are going to get a coach who sits down with you for an hour once or twice a week to give you tips. You're mistaken. Mauricio provides the entire coaching experience; he makes instructive videos for you; he gets to know your playing style; he will work with and get you to your goals. He wants to see you succeed. Mauricio is the kind of person who would be a chess coach for free if it was sustainable; that is the level of commitment he has to his students.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure about getting a chess coach, don't be. Send Mauricio a message. He will deepen your love for chess, share inspirational stories, provide advice that extends far outside of chess, and work hard for you. He will see you as a person, not as just a student. \r\n\r\nSimply put, I've experimented with several chess coaches before messaging Mauricio. Some were far more expensive, but none came close to the expertise, commitment, dedication and have improved my chess as much as Mauricio has.\r\n\r\n",

I chose Mr. Arias to be my coach for my goal of achieving NM strength in the USCF. I started by picking a few games I played that exemplified my playing style, and he immediately noticed my shortcomings. Upon this, he developed a plan of improvement that is focused on technique and endgame play. He made folders for me, organized the information, and assigned my readings and exercises to perform in my road of improvement. Within this week, he was also accessible anytime I happened to have a question and he was easily reachable over the phone. I shared games I played, and various positions to get his input of what his thoughts were. He was always there to answer my questions. Further, I started playing the opening he advised me to start playing and shared those games with him. When I felt down about how I played them, he immediately raised my spirits back up. In this way, he always encouraged me. The experience so far is incredible. And this is because coach IM Arias cares deeply about his students and their improvement. He is also not afraid to tell you when you have a weakness, and that you need to improve it. Lastly, he not only knows chess, but he played some of the best players in the world, and with a career of chess that spans over 20 years, he has lots of built-up knowledge and insight that will bring your game to the next level. I cannot wait to reach my goal with the help of coach IM Arias and I can confidently say that this is the best decision I've ever made in terms of my chess improvement.",

He also uses all the online tools that are available and affordable. \r\n I still have so much to learn but it has been a great experience so far!\r\nHis advice is very practical. For example we have picked just a few openings and are studying them very deeply rathe than trying to learn 100 different openings and being mediocre at all of them. Also his ideas on mid game are very simple and elegant and provide a useful framework for decision making.

After just a handful of hours with him, I had taken a different look at my game. I especially find the analysis of my games with him incredibly profitable! The didactically understandable and individual explanation by a grandmaster cannot replace a computer, textbook or instructional video for a long time. Great class! ",

Matias on the other hand takes great care. He asked me to send a few of my games and looking at them he concluded (quite rightly) that my strong point is strategy and positional play and advised me to give up e4 and play d4. He works with me on a very personal basis in developing my repertoire too.  He is very affordable and worth every cent you pay him. I would wholeheartedly recommend Matias for all players from 1000 - 2000 FIDE!",

Studying chess with him has been one of the most pleasant activities of the last few years.",

I've seen Alexis teaching all kind of players, from beginners to IMs; he knows how to steer the narrative to make everything clear and logical.

Sasa vermittelt dabei eine standardisierte Denkroutine, mit der man Stellungen betrachtet, bewertet und den besten Zug zu finden versucht. Besonders hilfreich f√ºr mich sind dabei die \"Prinzipien\", die Sasa immer wieder anspricht und wiederholt, bis man sie verstanden hat und in eigene Entscheidungen einfliessen lassen kann, um abseits von purer Zugberechnung gute Z√ºge zu finden. Besonders effektiv ist f√ºr mich, dass ich immer wieder 5 Minuten mit einer Stellung \"allein\" gelassen bin, mich wirklich vertiefen und mir intensive Gedanken machen muss und wir danach alles durchsprechen. \r\nSasa ist dabei immer sehr nett, geduldig und es macht immer Spass.

He is very patient with me when I can‚Äôt find a solution. I mainly hired him to help me build a new Black repertoire and he has done a fabulous job. I am playing better with Black than i have in my whole life. This is the honest truth, my blitz rating has gone up about 100 points in the last 2 months. I feel my understanding is a full step better as well, plus I have confidence versus players that are stronger than me. I don‚Äôt win them all, but at least every game seems to be a solid fight - no more getting mopped up early.

But before taking Yevhenii's lessons, they've never study chess in any formal way. \r\nLet me review Yevhenii's coaching from several perspectives. \r\nFirst, he is always very responsive and punctual. I put these two points first because I think these are simply necessary virtues for online chess coaches. Can you imagine you can't get in touch with your coach when everything is ready on your side? Trust me, unless some unforeseen things happen, you would never have bad experience like that with Yevhenii. \r\nSecond, my sons enjoy Yevhenii's lessons. He is an IM, but he can communicate with kids at my son's age. My two sons tell me that they can understand pretty much everything Yevhenii teaches them. Yet this does not mean that the lessons are not challenging at times. Yevhenii will push them a bit whenever he sees fit. \r\nThird, before taking Yevhenii's lessons, none of my sons are in county team (we live in the U.K.). They play for a local primary school team. Their board order is very low. With the lessons going on, my sons are also making progress. Now my younger son is in county team board 4 (out of 12) and school U9 board 1 (out of 6). My old son is selected for county U11 team for training. Hopefullly he will get in the team soon. As you can tell, it is much harder for older kids who started late to catch up. At school, my older son is board 2 in the B team. \r\nYes, basically this is what I want to say. Yevhenii is a responsive coach who is good at teaching kids (well, I bet adults, too). ",

He ask his students (like me) to verbally tell him what is my thought process. By doing so, he spots the weakness in my reasoning and logic. In so doing, he is able to correct my thought process, create new pathways in my rationale and thus improve my chess. Is not about learning a bunch of moves or openings (something he recommends doing at a very advance level) but rather, like Polgar herself recommended me when I spoke to her, that I should focus my chess on strategy, positions, and the like. This is what Nacho is doing with me and I feel that my goal of reaching 1,800 ELO is not only achievable, but rather a first step, knowing I can have him as a coach for life. Do yourself a favor, book a lesson with him and you will realize why I have chosen him as my ONLY coach even if I reach 2,000 ELO.

I have found that he is able to strike a perfect balance between keeping things fun and interesting, yet also remaining productive and goal focussed.\r\n  - Nacho will work with you to find out exactly what you want from chess, set realistic long term and short term goals, and he will tailor his coaching to address your weaknesses and ways you would like you to improve. \r\n  - If you want it, he'll also keep you accountable, and assign you as much homework/designate a personal study plan for you to work on if you're hungry for it. \r\n  - For those adult learners like myself who have a busy schedule would like a more relaxed approach to learning, I've found he's been incredibly accommodating, and has made his coaching ideal for my specific needs. \r\n  - Nacho also has an innate talent for connecting with people, forming a solid friendship, and adapting his teaching style to align with the way you respond best to learning. \r\n  - He will challenge the way you think about chess and strategy holistically, from the fundamentals, to specific topics like psychology, certain opening lines/prep, or habits on and off the board that are holding you back. \r\n  - Also for what you're getting his hourly rate is very very competitive. \r\n\r\nSpeaking from the experience of an adult learner, I highly recommend Nacho for a coach, I don't think you could find a better one.

I'll try to be more descriptive under the below headings to reflect the experience she provides you with.\r\n\r\nKnowledge: Diana clearly has a wide and impressive knowledge of this complex sport. I was taken aback by her playing experience listed in her coach profile and it is evident in all her lessons (be they focusing on openings, end game, tactics, etc). I think more important is her ability to understand where you are at as a player with your unique strengths and weaknesses. Her in-class probing questions or her after class tasks are always pitched at that sweet spot of being doable but with an effort sufficient to really drive improvement. She is also always very adept at giving gentle almost subliminal hints for particularly challenging questions (only when needed).\r\n\r\nProfessionalism: Diana's work ethic is also one of the striking features of working with her. During her lessons, you will experience her pour over both sample games and your own games which enhanced your understanding of various principles. Her provision of a wide variety of 'home work'¬† has also vastly enhanced my tactical vision. She is always very giving with her time too. Lessons are never cut off upon the end of the paid hour but let to come to their natural end so that learning is cemented.\r\n",

In addition he works with me on tactics and positional chess to make sure I am becoming as well rounded as possible given the limited amount of time I can currently dedicate to chess.

After playing some test matches, he helped me to get a more consistent opening strategy, and we tackled the weaknesses in my play one by one. In this stage, I felt I wasn't just taking steps, but leaps. Now, we focus on game analysis. During the analysis it is clear that Thibault has a vast knowledge and a quick mind, and he most importantly has the gift to share his insights in a manageable way. He also senses when he needs to check if a position is really understood and to show/hint why this or that variation is superior/inferior, the mark of a good teacher. \r\nIt's a very encouraging experience to be coached by him and I look forward to our next lesson!",

But, more importantly, he helped me to come back to the game I played a lot as a child and after 35 years, I am going to play a real chess tournament.\r\nYou can expect from Novak to build your opening portfolio, to the level that it will be very hard to surprise you. He will focus on your favorite openings, not his. He will look for solid, but not so common variations, so that you can surprise your opponents! \r\nHe reviews your games, finds common mistakes and focuses on them. \r\nA typical lesson will include review of my lichess online games. We would review openings, sometimes learn a new variation and the rest of lesson is the middle game or end game strategy. Sometimes we focus on attacking tactics, but mostly on strategy in a given position. We discuss how to defend a position or how to use the minimal advantage that exists in a given position. We review some famous games.\r\nNovak is a passionate teacher and I strongly recommend him.",

Novak's knowledge especially of openings is prolific, while at the same time only focusing on the most relevant factors.\r\n\r\nAside from this I will mention that Novak is incredibly generous with his time outside of the lessons as well, he has sent me several opening files that can only be described as top quality, and they have helped me win real games in tournaments.\r\n\r\nLastly, I should add that Novak is also ambitious about improving- in the past I have worked with coaches who seemed more or less content to stay at their level, but Novak still has aspirations of improving (as he should, he's a relatively young IM who is close to the GM title). I have found this to be motivating as well, and it has inspired me to work harder outside of the lessons.\r\n\r\nIn short, for only 25‚Ç¨/h, I do not think there is a better deal elsewhere.",

One hour of regular Training costs you 30 Euros (compared with other GMs a great price), but you are getting much more in return than just one hour of Training. The first point is that the lesson doesn‚Äôt finishes when the time you paid is over, but when Cyril has shown you, what he wanted to teach. He never complains or charges you extra money when the lesson goes into overtime ‚Äì most often you‚Äôll have to remind him of the clock.  When you want to analyse your games with him, he annotates them before the lesson and presents you during the Training a deep analysis, that also contain useful hints for your repertoire.  If you then chose to work on your openings, he teaches you useful methods to master your variations and how to work on your own. In my case he also gave me some excellent opening files, that really helped me to complete my black repertoire. \r\nAll in all: If you are searching for a coach, you should give Cyril a try, he is very passionate about teaching his students and also very flexible, since he can offer you lessons at almost any time.

He teaches you how to confidently break down a position into its component motifs and plans, and then stitch them back together into a complete understanding.\r\n\r\nLogistically, Brandon's been a joy to work with.

I think that while I'm not playing proper chess yet, Brandon has helped deepen my understanding of the game at a reasonable rate with an extremely flexible schedule. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to navigate chess but as a teacher Brandon tries to impart wisdom by analyzing positions to understand the imbalances inherent to those positions. Not unlike IM Silman's teachings. \r\n\r\nBrandon is a teacher who knows probably close to every trick in the book but is still someone you can have a normal conversation with.

I cannot emphasize how outstanding Zach is as a teacher and if you are passionate about the game of chess and are eager to learn, you will not regret the decision to take lessons with Zach.",

His approach is balanced between theoretical chess and practical chess. He not only has a deep understanding of theory, but he knows exactly how to teach those theories in accessible and applicable ways. \r\n\r\nWhen I first started my weekly, 2-hour sessions with Zach, I was stuck at about a 1350-1400 (Elo on chess.com). I wasn't able to stabilize my rating, let alone improve it. After one month of sessions with Zach, my rating is now almost 1600, and I feel I have a much better understanding of middlegame dynamics and decision making. All thanks to Zach. \r\n\r\nZach not only identified my strengths and weaknesses but gave me specific, detailed lesson plans and homework to work on between our sessions. It is clear that Zach, as a trained teacher, is a professional that knows how to apply his pedagogical approach to coaching chess. \r\n\r\nOn top of all of his knowledge and interactive sessions, Zach is very funny. His wit and humour keep sessions light hearted while also expressing clear expectations and discipline to make sure you are serious about improving. \r\n\r\nIn short, Zach is a gifted teacher, and we are lucky to have his coaching skills in the chess community.",

As we progressed, he quickly identified areas to best focus on to improve my game in the limited amount of time I had to study. His knowledge of wide variety of teaching tools allows him to quickly recommend a pivot to address some area. It has been fun exploring the variety of problems/tools aimed at identifying areas of improvement. With each identified problem, we set measurable and achievable goals. This data-oriented approach allows instant feedback to visually see that I am improving in between sessions. The one-on-one sessions are not your run of the mill lecture (you can go to youtube if you want that), but are highly interactive between student and teacher. This approach lets him dig into your brain to more quickly identify potential problem areas as he is teaching.

Her lessons are very well structured and I have benefited from them tremendously. I decided to look for private coaching because I had hit a plateau in the way I was playing, and was aimlessly jumping from one dvd course to another without seeing much benefit. Aside for each lesson being well structured, there is a good flow from one week to another, we started with basic end game principles and have been working toward more advanced positions. Each lesson structure consists of us going over homework which is a set of about 15-20 problems on a tactical theme, the we analyze a particular type of positions or games for a given theme, and conclude with a few tactical problems that are related to the next homework theme. Unlike passively watching videos, when I do something wrong in the lesson I no longer have my wrong inner confidence tell me that I am still correct and can move on, I think this has helped me solidify some understanding better. Overall I would say having a better understanding of the themes we have covered have allowed me to construct better plans in positions where I would previously go into blind liquidation. As far as my rating improvement goes, it has become less volatility, on chess.com, I used to fluctuate between 1400-1600, I am now consistently staying in the 1600s breaking into 1700. ",

Everything changed for the better, i found Aleks on lichess. \r\n\r\nShe has made a huge and immediate impact on my game. In under 3 months my rating on chess.com went up about 220 points and over 1000 puzzle rating. She has a clear idea of what you need as a student for your level. Though, she is open to your suggestions of what you want to learn, but from my personal experience i would say just trust her and stick to her plan for you. \r\n\r\nBest part about Aleks is that she really cares about your overall improvement,  you are not just one more student that she has to clock in every week and then when the session is done its good bye. She is very helpful answering any Qs , most of them silly on my part :), and advices during the week as well. \r\n\r\nWe meet weekly for 2 hours, initially started with one hour but I felt i needed more time. We start the sessions going through homework exercises , I get about 50-60 problems a week for homework. And then we analyze my games from the week, i usually have about 5-6 games a week, this to me is the best part of the session. She is literally like a machine (with a heart :)) when looking at your games and dumbs things down to your level and explain whats going on in the game and what moves i could have played better and why. The rest of the session, she picks up our next topic for me to learn and goes through some theory and then we work out exercises together.  We are currently doing different tactics motifs.\r\n\r\nAleks will make sure you are putting your are working in right area and  but you have to put in the effort.\r\n\r\n I would highly recommend her to any one seeking to improve their games. As i said before she is more than just an instructor you meet periodically in your sessions, she is a coach in the real sense of the that word. \r\nAlso, she is a top level WIM from Georgia!!! ",

Volodymyr's mastery of the game makes him instantly understand and anticipate your questions and patterns of thoughts in an impressive, enjoyable, and useful way, and his didactic skills (which I think are hardly matchable) make him convey information in a very clear and concise manner.  Further, he makes his classes diverse by providing a mix between tactics, strategy, games analysis, theory and practice. That generates a very interesting and fun experience, while also providing good moments of laughs with that very sympathetic coach. Volodymyr is also flexible and extremely committed, adapting his teaching to your objectives and time availability, and takes the time to give you (and correct) additional exercises between lessons if you want to progress faster. He speaks perfect English, and the price/quality ratio of that coach is in my opinion simply unmatchable.",

And not only would I recommend him, but after having completed a series of 6 lessons with him, I'm already arranging to schedule another 6.  He is generous with his time, genuinely interested in his students as chess players and as people, and, for English speakers, his English is excellent.  He has an outstanding approach to simplify complex chess concepts and teach them in a way that makes them not only understandable, but usable as well.  Plus, he's already put me on a path to amplify my self-improvement now that the lessons are complete.\r\n\r\nNemanja is a polite, and extremely knowledgeable instructor.

As a 1700 Elo player, I faced opponents with ratings ranging from +200 to +400 during my league games. Unfortunately, I had not secured any wins, so I decided to seek the guidance of a 2000+ player to enhance my chess skills and prepare for this important match. Fortunately, I discovered Adriana, and I couldn't be happier with my decision.\r\n\r\nAdriana is an incredibly talented chess player and an excellent training partner. We dedicated ourselves to intensive training sessions every day for ten days leading up to the match. Words cannot express how thrilled I was when I finally achieved victory against a 1900-rated player. The games with Adriana were incredibly enjoyable, and she proved to be an exceptional chess coach. Moreover, she is a delightful person to interact with, making our sessions all the more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI am already looking forward to booking more classes with Adriana for my future competitions and league games. Her expertise and guidance have made a significant impact on my chess skills, and I am confident that continued training with her will yield even better results. I cannot thank Adriana enough for her support and the positive impact she has had on my game. I wholeheartedly recommend Adriana to anyone seeking to improve their chess skills and have a wonderful training experience.\r\n\r\nThank you, Adriana, for your outstanding coaching and for being such a fantastic person to work with. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to train with you, and I am excited to continue our chess journey together.",

You can tell that she knows her stuff. I liked this lesson so much that I have reviewed many more games with her in the following lessons. We have also used the time to discuss good and bad pieces and how to handle various openings and middlegame plans that my opponents throw at me. She always provides a pgn file of my games with her analysis and comments added in so I can review them later.\r\n\r\nIn short: a great coach at a great price! \r\n",

Her mother is a Master, her father is a Grandmaster and Master Tijana is the heir apparent to her family's throne. Within the first week of her teachings, she lifted my chess rating by 100 points and we are just getting started. She is my secret weapon, I employ her to sharpen my mind and open my eyes to any blind spots I may have. It is a great honor to call her Master and I will be her student until I can stand next to her in battle with the Blagojevic flag behind me pouncing on my opponents. So if you love chess and have a desire to get better, learn from a documented champion and join us in battle. But if you decline be prepared to have nightmares of us rushing your castle and knocking down every piece along the way until we have your King in a checkmated square.

Of course, during the lesson, he will give useful tips and knowledge about typical positions or methods but the valuable things I took away from the lessons is definitely different approaches to thinking in different positions - things i have not seen mentioned in books.

				"text" : "I have had the guidance of Matt Slomsky since January 2019. Since then he has helped me improve in chess. Not only is he a gifted chess player, who is great at putting himself in his opponent‚Äôs shoes, but he is a masterful coach. He is able to put himself in the mind of his students and find ways they can improve. Matt is great at actively working with his students and giving them customized puzzles to solve, and personalized training to fit the needs of any student. He is good at working with people individually and good at working with group classes. As a coach, he is very humble and puts himself at the same level as his student. He shows a leadership quality where he multiplies the strength of his students and lets the students know they have a high value and he is good at helping them realize their own chess potential. As a leader he challenges people to accomplish tasks they would have thought to be impossible. His training is very flexible and he is great at training people at any level. He personally gave an incredible lesson to me and an expert player and taught a lot about patterns we have never even seen before. One of the puzzles in that lesson, which I have solved under his guidance, was unsolvable by a computer. Matt has refined his coaching technique by gaining insight from Eugene Perelshteyn and Attila Turzo. His own practical chess experience helps alot and he is able to give any student the tools necessary for exceeding chess expectations. I do not think there is any coach like him that exists, he really is one of a kind. He is a person who truly loves the game, and he has a passion for teaching others and seeing them improve. As his student, your success is his success, and he is always very proud to see his students showcase their incredible talent and ability. He helps cultivate a growth mindset and varies the methods of providing information and ensures that there is kinesthetic learning, visual learning, and audio learning.",

He's my first ever private chess coach and as a relatively new player picking up chess as a hobby last year, he has helped me improve my rating from 1350 on chess.com to 1650 in just two and a half months! \r\n\r\nHe is always prepared for the classes with new exercises or explanations, he assigns weekly homework that we go over in class, and the overall structure of the classes are great. One of things that makes him a great coach is his teaching method in which he focuses on all aspects of the game: openings, middlegame, strategy, tactics, endgames, and even takes me back through history to analyze famous games as well. I think he is an excellent coach for anyone who is serious about improving on their chess and if you put in a lot of work on your end he'll be sure to guide you to becoming a stronger player. \r\n\r\nHe always pushes you to do your best and although sometimes he can be a little hard on you, that's really just because he is so passionate about the game and wants to see you improve to your maximum potential.",

In 2 hours we do so much. With him as my coach, I have gained 100+ Fide points. I had problems with some openings and he showed lines in them which I enjoy to play. When he teaches openings, he teaches the lines and the plans white or black has in the opening. When he teaches middlegames we have a theme. He explains the theme first and then he gives exercises to the theme and gives me time to solve it, he explains the solution good as well. When he teaches endgames he have a theme and teach about it first and then gives exercises and explains them.

I reached out to GM Rogic for lessons after about 6 months of playing online and trying to improve (yes, I am another person who watched \"The Queen's Gambit\") and have been working with him for over a year. At the time I was (am?) very much a novice player.\r\n\r\nDavor focuses on chess strategy, not short-term tactics and that has been extremely educational. The first thing I learned that I wasn't really losing games because \"my opponent found a tactic\". Instead, I was not developing my pieces, positioning them poorly, wasting time with useless moves, making bad trades, or choosing bad attacking plans . These poor strategic choices would leading to positions where falling victim to a tactic was basically inevitable. On the other hand, I found that if I managed to develop my pieces,  position them well, make purposeful moves, and choose reasonable attacking plans I started winning a lot more games and the tactics would be in my favor. Davor's approach of emphasizing \"simple chess\", not complex ideas and deep calculation makes the game accessible and learnable. I'm not going to threaten any master-level players with these concepts, but they are extremely effective at my level of play. I would compare Davor's teaching style in this area to the way Daniel Naroditsky explains chess in his youtube videos.\r\n\r\nDavor also revamped my opening repertoire, replacing complex openings that I was bad at with simpler approaches. He patiently explained the strategic concepts behind the new openings and my win rate went up.\r\n\r\nResult: My online ratings all went up 100-200 points in the first year of training and people.

I can highly recommend him as a chess coach to anyone who wants to seriously improve his chess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
